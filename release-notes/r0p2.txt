Myrddin 0.2.1: "Works for Me"
=====================================

Myrddin 0.2.1 has been relesed. This release adds support for OpenBSD
6.3.

Packages and Installation
-------------------------

Myrddin 0.2 is being packaged for supported systems. Some of them may
be behind, as packagers finish putting together updated packages.

It is also easy to install from source.

#### From Git

Myrddin is a young language. There are regular fixes to the language and
libraries. Therefore, it's probably a good idea to install it from Git. To
install Myrddin from source:

	$ git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/ori/mc.git
	$ cd mc
	$ git checkout r0.2.1
	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
	# On BSD, use gmake
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

Myrddin 0.2: "9 out of 10 cats agree"
=====================================

Myrddin 0.2 has been released. This release was focused on filing off the
sharp edges shipped with the previous release. But not to worry, there are
still plenty of stabby bits left for the masochists.

Breaking Changes
----------------

- std.Ordonly and std.Owronly have been named to std.Oread and std.Owrite.
- `for x in y` became `for x : y`. It's only a warning right now, but it will
  break your code soon.
- Sigpipe is no longer handled by default.
- readv and writev now use iovec structs instead of slices.
- Solsock is now called Solsocket, and it's type changed to match getsockopt.
- Output no longer clutters the source directory, but instead goes into
  `obj/`.
- The `std.listen` API has been merged with `std.accept`.
- `mbld test` no longer impliciltly adds files to the test build.
- Custom hash functions return int64, not int32.
- Several unnecessary options (`-d`, `-l`, `-C`, `-M`) were removed from mbld.

New External Libraries and Programs
--------------------------

Yep, there's code thats not part of the main Myrddin distribution.

- [Libtermdraw](https://git.eigenstate.org/ori/libtermdraw.git): A library
  for doing curses-like drawing on the terminal.
- [Mparse](https://git.eigenstate.org/ori/mparse.git): A library
  written in Myrddin, that parses Myrddin.
- [irc.myr](https://git.eigenstate.org/ori/irc.myr.git): A simple IRC
  client, reminiscent of irssi.
- [Sergen](https://git.eigenstate.org/ori/sergen.git): A crude reinvention
  of protobufs/thrift.
- [Libwl](https://github.com/michaelforney/libwl): A wayland client library.
- [ddmin](https://github.com/andrewchambers/ddmin): A tool for paring down a
  large testcase into a minimal one.
