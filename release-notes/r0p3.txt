Myrddin 0.3.0: "Trust Us, We're Proffessionals"
===============================================

Myrddin 0.3 has been released. This is the first Myrddin release that is being
used in a commercial setting. Sure, it's a continuous build system, and one
day we'll outgrow it within the org, but for now, that makes us a commercial
success, right?

Major Highlights since 0.2
--------------------------

Lots of churn. The bulk of the code size increase has been adding
tests for many of our libraries.

	$ git diff --stat r0.2.2..HEAD | tail -n 1
	322 files changed, 34451 insertions(+), 3860 deletions(-)
	$ git log r0.2.2..HEAD --pretty=oneline | wc -l
	359

- The 'in' token has been removed fully. Now, `for elt in seq` is invalid
  syntax: it must be written as `for elt : seq`. This frees up a useful
  variable name.
- A `default.nix` has been added for building on systems.
- Many language bugs have been fixed, including trait issues, thanks to
  lgv.
	- Traits should work far more reliably.
	- We should be more agressive about flagging uses of uninitialized
	  variables.
	- Linking against C works on OpenBSD
- Several language features have been added
	- Enums should be slightly cheaper (thanks, mpu)
	- Auto declarations are now supported.
	- You can use `==` on enum style unions
- Many library bugs have been fixed, covering everything from
  the memory allocator, through to dealing with packet loss correctly
  in the DNS resolver.
- Mbld is a bit smarter in several ways.
	- It knows when the compiler or libraries changed, so it will now
	  rebuild your myrddin install changes. This prevents some mysterious
	  build failures around mismatched library versions.
	- mbld now outputs to `obj/` instead of the current working directory,
	  leading to cleaner builds.
	- mbld knows how to run subsets of tests.
	- Several new CPU type tags are set by default.
- Several new libraries have been added, most notably:
	- [libmath](https://git.eigenstate.org/ori/mc.git/tree/lib/math),
	  which implements several floating point functions of interest
	  from scratch.
	- [libflate](https://git.eigenstate.org/ori/mc.git/tree/lib/flate),
	  which implements gzip compression/decompression.
- Several  existing ones have been significantly improved.
	- Libthread is now usable on OSX, thanks to the work of iriri. It also
	  now uses futexes on OpenBSD, significantly improving its performance
	  and behavior.
	- Several threading bugs have been fixed in libstd, largely focused
	  around forking and execing in a threaded program.
	- Pledge has been added to libstd. It's invokes pledge on OpenBSD,
	  and is a no-op on deficient platforms.
	- Constant time RSA has been implemented in libcrypto, following the lead of
	  BearSSL
	- AES GCM mode is now implemented in libcrypto.
	- SHA HMAC functions are now implemented in libcrypto.
	- Libbio now has a vtable, and therefore can be used to buffer any
	  stream of data.
- Others have been less significantly improved.
	- Integers can be printed in any base.
	- std.put now will allow printing arbitrary binary data, instead of
	  just unicode.
	- Libstd now counts graphemes instead of simply counting codepoints
	  when outputting text.
	- Libtermdraw also counts graphemes instead of codepoints.
	- Regex has been sped up by several times.
	- libfileutil has had several API signatures changed, and now
	  has code to remove file trees recursively.
- IPv6 is now fully supported.
- The size of generated binaries is now smaller, thanks to enabling
  `--gc-sections` by default on platforms that support it.
- Dependent system tags can now be defined.
- Several new APIs have been added, including:
- Support for OpenBSD 6.3 (from 0.2.2)

Breaking changes
----------------

- Auto variables have been removed in favor of the auto operator.
- Trait syntax has been changed, in order to reduce repetition and allow for
  auxiliary types to be attached to traits.
- The earlier `for, in` change.
- libbio now returns `std.result(@t, bio.err)` instead of a custom
  `bio.status(@t)` type.
- Hash tables now use traits instead of callbacks, meaning that all
  hash tables using `std.mkht(hashfn, cmpfn)` need to be replaced
  with `std.mkht()`. The types should be inferred appropriately in
  most cases.
- The various equality checking functions have been removed in favor
  of trait overloading `std.eq`.
- Several iterators have been moved out of libstd and into libiter

Feature Descriptions
--------------------

### In token

This change is pretty simple, but affects a *lot* of code:

	for elt in sequence
		frob(elt)
	;;

Can now only be written as

	for elt : sequence
		frob(elt)
	;;

This isn't a semantic change, but a trivial syntactic one. It frees up
a perfectly good variable name that I've wanted to use more than once.

This was a warning in the 0.2 series, and now it's a hard error.

### Dependent tags

Mbld now supports setting build tags that are dependent on other build
tags. Beside your `bld.proj`, there may now live a `bld.tags`, which
contains lines of the form:

	foo
	bar: baz sse4
	baz: freebsd
	baz: openbsd
	quux: bar baz x64

These lines set the tag on the right hand side if all of the tags on
the left hand side are satisfied. If there is no right hand side, then
the tag is unconditionally enabled. If you want to have an `or` of the
tag sets, repeat the line setting the tags. For example, if you want to
enable `baz` on freebsd or openbsd, write:

	baz: freebsd
	baz: openbsd

These tags are unordered, so tags later in the file may enable tags
earlier in the file.

These tags are used to enable futex tags when building the thread library.
Look [here](https://git.eigenstate.org/ori/mc.git/tree/bld.tags) for an
example.

### Auto operator

During the Myrcon last September we discussed an 'auto' operator
that would evaluate what it applies to, store the result in a
temporary t, and call __dispose__(t) when the current block exits.

This patch has been implemented. We added a unary operator. This, for
instance, allows to have:

	impl disposable regex# =
		__dispose__ = {r; regex.free(r)}
	;;

	regex.exec(auto std.try(regex.compile("f..bar")), "foobar")

Like before, it is guaranteed that __dispose__ is called in
reverse order of auto appearance.

### Flate encoding

As an official summer of cod entry, we got a start for
the libflate library, which will eventually contain
Myrddin's [de]compression equipment.

It currently exposes a single function

	const decode : (outf : bio.file#, inf : bio.file# -> std.result(void, err))

that decodes a DEFLATE stream in the inf file into the
outf file. The function guarantees that it will not read
more than necessary from inf to either, figure out that
the stream is bogus, or fully uncompress the stream.

### Libmath

As part of the Summer of Cod, we also got the start of libmath landed. Libmath
is a library to implement some IEEE-754 functions (cos, sin, sqrt, &c). A
first milestone has been pulled. Here's what we've got:

- some initial IEEE-754 functions: exp, expm1, sqrt, trunc, ceil,
  floor, rn, scalB,

- some utility functions: algorithms for efficiently and accurately
  computing sums, evaluating polynomials, and performing fused
  multiply-add,

- improved support for feature flag detection with mbld: we can
  now check for fancy, non-universal CPU features like sse,

- an out-of-tree tool for comparing various IEEE-754 implementations:
  http://repo.or.cz/fpmath-consensus.git

Right now, the algorithms are coming from the survey work of Muller,
and in particular I'm working through an article series by Tang
describing tabular + polynomial approximation methods: see
lib/math/references in the tree.

Based on some informal analysis, we're achieving accuracy at least
on par with glibc and musl, and better in some situations. Our speed
appears to be at least within an order of magnitude of glibc for
the software implementations, and where hardware implementations
exist we're even better.


Packages and Installation
-------------------------

Myrddin 0.2 is being packaged for supported systems. Some of them may
be behind, as packagers finish putting together updated packages.

It is also easy to install from source.

#### From Git

Myrddin is a young language. There are regular fixes to the language and
libraries. Therefore, it's probably a good idea to install it from Git. To
install Myrddin from source:

	$ git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/ori/mc.git
	$ cd mc
	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
	# On BSD, use gmake
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

### From Tarballs

Tarballs of this release are also available

- [myrddin-0.3.0.tar.bz2](/releases/myrddin-0.3.0.tar.bz2)
- [myrddin-0.3.0.tar.gz](/releases/myrddin-0.3.0.tar.gz)
- [myrddin-0.3.0.tar.xz](/releases/myrddin-0.3.0.tar.xz)

#### Mac OSX

There is a brew tap for OSX. If you have Homebrew installed,
here is how you can use it to install Myrddin:

	$ brew install oridb/myrddin/myrddin

#### FreeBSD

The port for Myrddin is in the FreeBSD ports tree. You can install it
using:

	# pkg install myrddin

#### OpenBSD

The port for Myrddin is in the OpenBSD ports tree. You can install it
using:

	# pkg_add myrddin

#### Plan 9 (9front)

Because Mercurial is the version control mechanism for Plan 9, there
is a mirror of the repository on Bitbucket. To install it:

	% hg clone https://bitbucket.org/oridb/mc
	% cd mc
	% mk
	% mk install

Supported Platforms
-------------------

The 0.3 release comes with an amd64 compiler. The supported platforms are
Linux, OSX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Plan9. There is partial support
for NetBSD. Threads are known to be unimplemented on NetBSD.
