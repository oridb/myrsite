Subtests
-------

Often, simply running one binary per test is not sufficient. In many cases, it
makes a good deal of sense to bundle a large number of tests in one binary or
command. This can be because splitting each test into its own binary is
clunky, or because there are simply too many processes, or simply because
you don't want to test from Myrddin code -- instead, you may want to run a
script.

The mbld subtest protocol is designed to accomodate these uses. If a test,
of any sort, outputs data using the mtest protocol, then mbld will interpret
the subtests appropriately, displaying useful output for them, and logging
them at a more granular level than test binaries.

Using libtestr
--------------

Of course, writing while writing mtest output isn't difficult, it's often
convenient to have a test runner library available to you, which handles
the output directly. Myrddin ships with one such library for Myrddin,
`libtestr`. It can be used as follows:

	use testr

	const main = {
		testr.run([
			[.name="true", .fn={ctx; 
				std.check(true, "true isn't true\n")}],
			[.name="false", .fn={ctx; 
				std.check(!false, "!false isn't true\n")}],
		][:])
	}

For more information, take a look at [the testr documentation](/doc/libtestr)

The MTEST protocol
------------------

The mtest protocol is a simple test protocol inspired by
[TAP](https://testanything.org/tap-specification.html), although it is
designed to solve a number of difficulties with TAP, as well as allowing
for benchmark statistics to be transmitted.

An MTEST test starts with a test plan, which looks something like this:

	MTEST <ntests>

The test plan starts with the word 'MTEST' at the 0th character in the line,
followed by an integer `ntests` representing number of tests we expect to see.
If a negative number of tests is specified, then any number of tests are
accepted. The number of tests is given up front in order to make it easy to
detect missing tests.

This MTEST line may appear in the test output multiple times. Each time it
appears, it indicates that the prevous `ntests` tests must have successfully
completed, and that another `ntest` tests are expected. This allows multiple
runs of tests to be emitted by the test framework, with less pain in counting
them up front.

This is then followed by `ntest` test outputs. A test output looks like

	test <name> <<{!

This specifies the test name. After this come any number of lines of log
output, which may be preserved by the framework for later analysis. Finally,
this is followed by the test ending. The test ending is one of:

	!}>> ok
	!}>> fail <reason>
	!}>> timing <niter> <mean> <stddev>

which, respectively, indicate a pass, a fail, or a benchmark result.
The failure message is shown to the user by the test runner, and the
timing is tabulated and summarized by the test runner.

Writing your own provider
-------------------------

For Myrddin, writing a custom test provider is trivial. `libtestr` is
the best solution, but if it's unsuitable for whatever reason, an mbld
test binary is also a good solution:

	test foo =
		bar.myr
	;;

However, what if you want to write your own test script? This is also
not difficult:

	cmd my-test-cmd {test} =
		./test.sh
	;;

would suffice. Any command that `mbld` will run can be tagged as a test and
run this way. For a working example of a custom test script, you can look in
the 
[mbld test/ drectory for the compiler tests](https://github.com/oridb/mc/tree/master/test/bld.sub)
