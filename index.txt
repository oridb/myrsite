Myrddin
------------------------

```{runmyr introloop}
use std
const main = {
        for x in [(1, "let's"), (2, "get"), (3, "started")]
                std.put("{}\n", x)
        ;;
}
```

Myrddin is a systems programming language that covers a similar niche as C including 
desktop, OS, and embedded development, but at the same time making it harder to
shoot yourself in the foot.

It is designed to be a simple language that runs close to the
metal, giving the programmer predictable and transparent behavior and mental
model. It also does strong type checking, generics, type inference, closures,
and traits.

Myrddin is not a language designed to explore the forefront of type theory or
compiler technology. It is not a language that is focused on guaranteeing
perfect safety. It is satisfied to be a practical, small, fairly well defined,
and easy to understand language for code that needs to be close to the
hardware.

Major Features
--------------

- Type inference. Types are inferred across the whole program.
- Algebraic data types.
- And their friend, pattern matching.
- Generics.
- A package system.
- Low level control.
- (Almost) no runtime library.
- Entirely self contained.
- Simple and easy to understand implementation.

Try It Online
-------------

If you want to try before you buy, there is an online playground that you can
use to experiment with code. It's fairly restrictive, and prevents you from
using the vast majority of system calls, but it's enough to get a feel for
things.

[So, give it a shot.](http://eigenstate.org/myrddin/playground)

Code
------

The [code is available on both Github](https://github.com/oridb/mc),
and [on Eigenstate](https://git.eigenstate.org/ori/mc.git)

Status

Supported Platforms.
--------------------

Myrddin currently compiles for x86-64. It runs on four OSes at the moment:

- Linux
- OSX
- Plan 9 (9front)
- FreeBSD

It has proved relatively easy to port between these
systems, needing only a few system calls, and a couple of hundred lines of
code to get the bootstrap working.

Installing The Compiler
-----------------------

First, make sure you have the dependencies. To build you'll need Make, a C99
compiler, an AT&T syntax assembler, and a Posix YACC implementation. To clone
the repository you'll need git. On debian, you can run:

    sudo apt-get install bison gcc git make

Once you have the dependencies, you can clone the repo and build it. By
default, it will install to '/usr/local', but it can be installed anywhere by
running `./configure --prefix=/path/to/wherever`. Just be sure to remember to
add the prefix to $PATH before trying to run any commands, or your shell will
not be able to find them.

    git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/git/ori/mc.git
    cd mc               # the directory you cloned into
    make                # build it
    sudo make install   # defaults to /usr/local

Compiling Hello World
---------------------

The next step after getting the compiler installed is using it. An example
hello world program is below.

```{runmyr helloworld}
use std

const main = {args : byte[:][:] /* a slice of byte slices */
        std.put("Hello-世界\n")     /* prints to stdout */
        for a in args
                std.put("arg = {}\n", a)
        ;;
} 
```

To build it, put it in a file of your choice. I'll use hello.myr. Then, run

    mbld -b hello hello.myr

This will produce a binary called hello, which will print "Hello-世界", echo
all of the args given, and exit with a status of 0.

The mbld program wraps the entire build process for myrddin code. It
determines the dependencies, the build order, and manages the set of libraries
that need to be linked in to produce the final library or binary, assuming that
the included libraries are installed to the conventional location
($PREFIX/lib/myr).

As a result, it should generally be sufficient to run `mbld -b bin input.myr`
in order to build a binary.

Deconstructing Hello World
--------------------------

        use std

The statement 'use std' tells the Myrddin compiler to load the 'std' package
and make the functions in it available to our code.

        const main = {args : byte[:][:];...}

This is declaration where the anonymous function `{args; ...}` is assigned
the the constant value 'main'.. All function declarations in Myrddin are done
by assigning an anonymous function to a variable, generic, or constant.

The keyword `const` is one of the three ways of beginning a declaration. The
other two are `generic` and `var`.

Keyword   |  Meaning
----------|-----------
`generic` |  A generic value that the compiler will specialize  
`const`   |  A constant value. Should not be assignable. Mutability propagation semantics are TBD
`var`     |  A mutable, assignable value.

The general form of anonymous functions is `{arg, list; body_statements()}`.
Semicolons and newlines are interchangable through all Myrddin code.

        std.put("Hello-世界\n")

Invokes the function 'std.put', which came from the 'std' package, printing to
standard output. The string is encoded in utf8.

        for a in args
                std.put("arg {} = {}\n", i, args[i])
        ;;

A bog standard for loop. This instance uses the `for pattern in sequence`
syntax, which will iterate over type that is iterable, matching the values
with the pattern and executing the loop body if there is a valid pattern
match.

The alternative syntax, `for init; bound; incr` syntax is also acceptaed. For
this syntax, The initializer, test, and increment are all single expressions
terminated with a newline or semicolon. The `init` clause may include a
declaration.

In both cases, the body is a block terminated by a ';;'.

Beyond Hello World: Types
-------------------------

Myrddin supports a wide range of primitive types. Types are all
strong, with no implicit conversions between them.

   Type        |       Description
---------------|----------------------------------
   `void`      | A void type
   `bool`      | A boolean type
   `char`      | A single unicode codepoint
   `int8`      | A 8 bit integer
   `int16`     | A 16 bit integer
   `int32`     | A 32 bit integer
   `int64`     | A 64 bit integer
   `int`       | A native integer, 32 bits or greater
   `uint8`     | A 8 bit unsigned integer
   `uint16`    | A 16 bit unsigned integer
   `uint32`    | A 32 bit unsigned integer
   `uint64`    | A 64 bit unsigned integer
   `uint`      | A native unsigned integer, 32 bits or greater
   `flt32`     | A single precision floating point
   `flt64`     | A double precision floating point
   `...`       | A variadic argument list

In addition to primitive types, it has type paramters. Type
parameters act as variables which may be substituted with any
other type on invocation or use of a type.

When traits are specified, all traits must be present on the
substituted type in order for the substitution to proceed.

Type               | Description
-------------------|-------------------
`@t`               | A type paramter
`@t::trait`        | A type parameter with a trait
`@t::(trait,list)` | A type parameter with a list of traits.


Composite types are composed of primitive types, or other composite types.
There are three of these, which can be applied to any type. In Myrddin, slices
carry both the array data and the length, and may be taken off of pointers,
arrays, and other slices. A pointer only points to one element, and does not
support pointer arithmetic. And an array is of a fixed size, with the size
considered as part of its type.

Type>            | Description  
-----------------|--------------------------------------
`type#`          | A pointer to type 
`type[:]`        | A slice of type 
`type[SIZE]`     | A type array of size SIZE. 

Functions are specified with parentheses. The argument names are mandatory
in all tyle specifications, although the return type is optional. Tuples are
specified with square brackets. A better, but still conflict free syntax would
be welcome.


    
Type                            | Description
--------------------------------|------------------
`(arg : t1, list : t2 -> ret)`  | Function with 2 args and a return type
`(-> ret)`                      |  Function with 0 args and a return type
`(arg : t1)`                    |  Function with 1 arg and an implicit return
`[t1, t2, t3]`                  |  Three element tuple


Structs in Myrddin behave much like they do in C, and are actually binary
compatible in layout with the SysV struct ABI. Members are accessed with dot
notation, as `strct.memb`, and can be initialized as literals with the
struct literal notation `[.memb=val, .other=val]`
                             
    struct                   
           member : @t       
    ;;                       
                             
Unions in Myrddin are closer to algebraic data types in ML than they are to C unions.
The union knows the value that is currently being held in it, and is constructed
and matched with a tag. To construct a union, the `\`Tag val` syntax is used

    union
           `Tag1 t1
           `Tag2 t2
    ;;

Beyond Hello World: Packages
----------------------------

Myrddin has a simple package system, doing away with headers. Myrddin source
files can define the functions they export by including a package section,
which lists the exported symbols.

To use a package installed into the compiler search path, add use package_name
statement to your code. This will allow you to access 'package_name.symbol'.

To import symbols from a file within the same directory as your source code,
add use "filename.use". The package name that is brought in to your namespace
is determined by the 'pkg' spec within the source file being imported.

If two use statements load the same package (eg, two local files export symbols
for the 'foo' package), then the packages will be merged.

To create your own package, add a pkg block to it. While it's not necessarily,
stylistically, the exported symbols should have their types fully specified.

An example of a 3 source file program that uses a system import is given here.
`main.myr` will be importing all of the source files, and consuming the exported
symbols. It uses the system include `std`, as well as the two local usefiles that
provide the demo package, `say-hello.use` and `say-goodbye.use`

Unfortunately, since the runner that I have does not support multiple files,
this code will not build or run online. Sorry.

```{runmyr pkg1}
/* This is in main.myr */
use std
use "say-hello.use"
use "say-goodbye.use"

const main = {
        demo.sayhello()
        std.put("yo!")
        demo.saygoodbye()
        -> 0
}
```

`say-hello.myr` defines a package block that exports the function
`sayhello`, into the package `demo`, as well as providing the definition

```{runmyr pkg2}
/* This code is in say-hello.myr */
use std

pkg demo  =
        const sayhello : (-> void)
;;

const sayhello = {
        std.put("Hello\n")
}
```

`say-goodbye.myr` defines a package block that exports the function
`saygoodbye`, into the package `demo`, as well as providing the definition

```{runmyr pkg3}
/* This code is in say-goodbye.myr */
use std

pkg demo  =
        const saygoodbye : (-> void)
;;

const saygoodbye = {
        std.put("Goodbye\n")
}
```

The use files loaded by the use statement are generated by the 'muse' tool.
This tool will be invoked automatically as needed by 'mbld'.

Beyond Hello World: Pattern Matching
------------------------------------

I personally love the way that algebraic data types and pattern matching in
functional languages allows you to express only valid combinations of values in
your data structures. So, of course, Myrddin has that too.

At the moment the number of pattern types that can be matched over is somewhat
limited, but I hope to grow it to nearly anything that can be expressed as a
literal as soon as possible.

Simple primitive values are matchable

```{runmyr matchint}
use std

const main = {
        var v

        v = 234
        match v
        | 123:    std.put("First branch\n")
        | 234:    std.put("Second branch\n")
        | x:      std.put("What? Got {}\n", x)
        ;;
}
```

As are unions, structs, and any nesting of similar complex types:

```{runmyr complexmatch}
use std

type u = union
        `Some int
        `None
;;

type s = struct
        a : int
        b : u
        c : (int, int)
;;

const main = {
        var u
        var v : s

        /* initialize u to some value */
        u = `Some 234
        match u
        | `Some 123:    std.put("First branch\n")
        | `Some x:      std.put("Got some {}\n", x)
        | `None:        std.put("Got nothing\n")
        ;;

        v = [.a = 123, .b=`Some 456, .c=(5, 10)]
        match v
        | [.a = 234]:              std.put("Should not be here\n")
        | [.a = 123, .c=(x, y)]:   std.put("tuple is ({}, {})\n", x, y)
        ;;
}
```

Beyond Hello World: Closures
----------------------------

Myrddin also has support for closures, including environment capture. Closures
capture all variables in their scope by value at creation time. The
environment is stack allocated by default, but can be heapified on demand.

```{runmyr closures}
use std

const main = {
        var a, fn

        a = 123
        fn = {x
            std.put("inside closure: {}\n", x + a)
            a++ /* modify the captured copy of a */
        }
        fn(123) /* just call the function a few times */
        fn(0) /* we increment a */
        fn(0) /* for each call */
        std.put("a = {}\n", a)      /* but it doesn't change in the env */
}
```


Beyond Hello World: Generics
----------------------------

We often want algorithms to apply over many types, not just the ones that we
happened to code with. The Myrddin language provides facilities for this.
Unfortunately, parameterized types are not yet fully implemented, which
severely limits the usefulness of generics, but they are still useful.

A generic function is written exactly as a normal function would be, but the
keyword 'generic' is used in its declaration, instead of 'const'. A type
parameter is then given in the place of a concrete type, and you're off.

For the trivial example, here's a generic sizeof function

        generic gsizeof = {val : @a;
                -> sizeof(@a)
        }

But that's not very useful, so here's a generic max function. Because we need
to be able to use the > operator on the arguments of the function, we will need
to use a trait on the generic parameter. The trait that provides the comparison
operators is numeric

        generic max = {x : @a::numeric, y : @a::numeric
                if x > y
                        -> x
                else
                        -> y
                ;;
        }

Style
-----

Code should be short, simple, and direct, with little gratuitous layering of
abstraction. Algorithms should be described in a linear, straightforward
fashion, as a set of steps to perform.

Variables, types, and functions should be named lowercase. Constants should
begin with an Uppercase. Names should be short, evocative, and mnemonic, but
above all, consistent. A single verb is an ideal function name

        spawn(func)                            /* good */
        create_new_thread_with_function(func) /* bad */

Libraries
----------------

Myrddin ships with a number of useful libraries. The most common ones, and the
ones that ship with the compiler, are libsys, libstd, libbio, libregex,
libcryptohash, and libdate. Other libraries are in the works.

[Libstd](/myrddin/doc/libstd) handles functionality that most programs written
would find useful.  It's a bit of a grab bag, but it's useful.

[Libbio](/myrddin/doc/libbio) handles buffered IO, allowing you to do fancy
things with input and output, line reading linewise, or reading up to
delimiters.

[Libregex](/myrddin/doc/libregex) handles regexes. It implements a simple but powerful regex syntax,
and has working unicode support.

[Libcryptohash](/myrddin/doc/libcryptohash) provides cryptographic hashes. It
implements many of the most common ones.

[Libdate](/myrddin/doc/libdate) provides a fairly complete interface for
manipulating dates, times, and timezones.

C Binding
---------

It's possible on boxes that use the SysV ABI, but still has rough edges. The
ABI is only identical for C and Myrddin when looking at atomic types such as
pointers, integers, or floats.  There's some minor support in the build
system, but automated binding generation has only been started on.
