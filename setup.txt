}

Installing the Binaries
-----------------------

To get the source, for the compiler, standard library, and myrbuild, you
download it from git:

        git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/git/ori/mc.git

There are currently no released versions, and the language is in a heavy state
of flux. I promise that if you use it, and I break some of your code, I will
help port it to whatever the new sexiness is.

There are also a number of useful libraries:

        git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/git/ori/libbio.git
        git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/git/ori/libregex.git
        git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/git/ori/libcryptohash.git

These are downloaded and installed in the same manner.

Useful Supporting Tools
------------------------

There are a number of useful utilities for working with Myrddin that are
not shipped with the above.

### vim myr support

I have written indent and syntax scripts for vim. These scripts are fairly
sparse, but they serve me well. To get them, you can grab

        
They are also available separately as

    http://eigenstate.org/vim/indent/myr.vim
    http://eigenstate.org/vim/syntax/myr.vim
    http://eigenstate.org/vim/ftplugin/myr.vim
    http://eigenstate.org/vim/ftdetect/myr.vim

I also suggest setting the indentation and shift widths for Myrddin files
with an autocommand. To do that, add the text below to your .vimrc:

    " Indent .myr files with tabs
    autocmd FileType myr
                \ setlocal noet |
                \ setlocal sw=8
    
### ctags
I have added rudimentary Myrddin support to exuberant-ctags, which is
available here:

    git+ssh://git.eigenstate.org/git/ori/ctags-myr.git

This will generate ctags for all file types that exuberant ctags supports,
as well as Myrddin. It is not quite smart enough to handle parsing Myrddin
files too well, so it will pick up text within comments, for example, or
variables declared within functions. Still, having an index of symbols is
useful for source navigation.
