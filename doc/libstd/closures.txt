Summary: Closures
-----------------

pkg std =
        generic fndup   : (fn : @fn::function -> @fn::function)
	generic fnbdup  : (fn : @fn::function, buf : byte[:] -> @fn::function)
	generic fenvsz	: (fn : @fn::function -> size)
        generic fnfree  : (fn : @fn::function -> void)
;;

Overview
--------

Closures are useful, however, in Myrddin, they refer to an environment that
lives on the heap. In many cases, it is desirable to keep a closure around
for longer than the lifetime of the function that it is capturing variables
from.

These functions facilitate that need, by allowing the heapification and
freeing of a closure. This is only needed for functions that capture an
environment -- global functions may be passed without copying. This also holds
for local functions that do not refer to the environment.

Functions
---------

	generic fndup   : (fn : @fn::function -> @fn::function)

Takes any function, and copies the captured environment to the heap, if there
is an environment to copy.

	generic fnbdup  : (fn : @fn::function, buf : byte[:] -> @fn::function)

Takes any function, and copies the captured environment to the buffer
provided. The buffer must be at least as big as the value reported by
`fenvsz`.

	generic fenvsz	: (fn : @fn::function -> size)

Returns the size in bytes of the environment referenced by the closure `fn`.
If there is no environment, then this function returns `0`.

	generic fnfree  : (fn : @fn::function -> void)

Frees the environment of a function heapified with fndup.
