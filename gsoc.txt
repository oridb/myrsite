Getting in Contact
------------------

The Myrddin hackers hang out in #project79068 on irc.eigenstate.org. Most
design discussion happens there. The mentors are online using these screen
names:

###### Ori
Ori Bernstein

###### ac
Andrew Chambers

###### mpu
Quentin Carbonneaux

###### k0ga
Roberto Vargas

We also have a mailing list, `myrddin-dev@eigenstate.org`, which you can sign
browse and sign up for here: [Mailing List](http://eigenstate.org/mail-lists).
This is low traffic.

How to get Selected
-------------------

The most important thing to do to get accepted is to talk to us. We'll be glad
to help answer questions as you explore the projects of interest. A proposal
will not be entirely new to the people evaluating it -- while the bulk of the
work of writing it will be done by you, we will probably have helped flesh in
parts of it. This isn't an exam, and there's no such thing as cheating.

When we evaluate a proposal, we are trying to decide two things. First, we are
trying to understand whether the project will be useful to us. If the end
product doesn't solve a real problem, then we are unlikely to accept the
project. Second, we are looking for evidence that indicates that you, the
student, are able to successfully complete the project.

Therefore, a good proposal will hit all of the following points:

- Who are you? What are you studying, what problems do you find interesting?

- What project do you want to do?

- How will you apporoach the project? What stages will you break it down into,
  how long do you expect each stage to take?

- What are the biggest anticipated challenges?

Summer of Code Project Ideas
----------------------------

### Come with your own ideas
You are smart and imaginative, and there's no end of work on the queue. Feel
free to propose your own idea. We'd be glad to discuss it with you before you
submit to assess viability and usefulness.

###### Expected Results
You tell us!

###### Knowledge Prerequisite
Yes.

### System Call Generator
Currently, Myrddin system calls are implmented by hand for a small number of
system calls, which are added as needed. Implementing a system call generator
will write code that takes a machine readable list of system calls provided by
the OS (for example, under FreeBSD, there is a file named syscalls.master),
and generates a `sys` package that Myrddin can use.

###### Expected Results
By the end of this project, all Myrddin system calls for at
least two major platforms will be implemented via autogeneration. 

Knowlege Prerequisite: Bash scripting, writing makefiles, x86\_64 assembly

### Porting the Myrddin Runtime to Windows
Begin a port of the Myrddin progrmaming language to Windows. The porting process
will involve compiler tweaks, assembly programming, interfacing with the OS at a low level
and contributing to the design of Myrddin standard library.

###### Expected results
The standard mc toolchain can be compiled for windows using a cygwin based environment. 
Enough of the standard library will be functional such that the standard build tool 'mbld' can
be used. This means runtime initialization, memory allocation and basic file io will work at as a minimum.

An excellent student can aditionally tackle other aspects of the std library including
threads, sockets and any other aspect of the stdlib the student finds interesting and beneficial.

###### Knowledge Prerequisite
C programming, Bash scripting, writing makefiles, x86\_64 assembly basics,
general knowledge of windows api's, general operating systems knowledge.

### New Assembler/Linker
Create a new x86-64 assembler and linker for the Myrddin compiler toolchain.

This project will involve implementing a simple assembler and linker for
Myrddin, written in Myrddin. The assembler will produce type information for
the compiler. It will also produce a single output format.

The linker will consume a single input binary type, and output a statically
linked binary in the format needed for all supported platforms.

###### Expected results
At the end of the summer, an assembler and linker will exist which can produce
binaries for at least one target platform. The Myrddin compiler will be
modified to invoke this compiler to generate binaries.

###### Knowledge Prerequisite
C programming, Bash scripting, writing makefiles, x86\_64 assembly basics.

### Implement Myrddin parser in Myrddin
Myrddin currently has a parser, but this parser is written
in C using Yacc. This project will build a parser library for Myrddin that can
be consumed from other Myrddin code, and used for building tools, and
eventually making the compiler self hosting.

###### Expected results
By the end of the project, the student will have a parser implemented that can
parse itself, the Myrddin standard library, and spit out an abstract syntax
tree for the code.

###### Knowledge Prerequisite: 
Parsing algorithms, Bash scripting, writing makefiles, x86\_64 assembly basics.

### Implement DWARF debug information
Curently, Myrddin is debugged at the assembly level, with comments that allow
cross referencing line number information. While this is managable, it is far
from ideal.

This project would implement DWARF debug information, finishing threading type
information through the backend code, emitting information to track locations

###### Expected results
All assembly code in the Myrddin project will be written using an assembler
written in Myrddin. The compiler will be able to bootstrap using this
assembler.

### Implement Optimizations for QBE
QBE currently has a number of optimizations that are not implemented. A
student that is interested in adding an optimization to QBE will select an
optimization, make a case for why this optimization is a good choice to
implemnt, and write code to implmeent it.

###### Expected results
QBE will have a new optimization that makes many benchmarks run faster.

### Implement new backend for QBE
QBE currently only supports x86-64. This project would add a new supported 
target architecture. This would involve refactoring the middle end to make
sure that there are no target architectures, and adding the code to emit
assembly for this new system. Of particular interest is one of the various
ARM platforms, including Armv8.

###### Expected results
QBE will be able to emit code for the selected target architecture by the
end of the summer.
